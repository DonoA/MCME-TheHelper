Tracks for new players, and sends valuable information to them.

As of now, the Plugin does the following:

- Checks if the player is a new player or not by verifying if theres a valid profile within the world folder.
- If no profile was found, it broadcasts a message server wide informing everyone that the player is new.
- The new player will receive various information on his first join, such as a link to the forum, and pointing out that Rangers are there to help/assist new players.
