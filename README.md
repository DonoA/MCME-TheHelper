TheHelper
=========

TheHelper implements the use of the /helper commands, and the /devinfo commands. It is also used to help new players when they first join the server. It gives basic help about the forums, texture packs, and TeamSpeak. The /helper command accepts one too two arguments and is meant to help improve the speed of finding valuable information. 
The syntax for /helper is as follows:
*forums
*textures
*map
*servers
*pm “player”

Most of the commands are straightforward, forums sends you a link to the forums, and server sends you a list of the server ips. pm is a command that allows you to start conversations through minecraft. The pm command will return a link to create a new conversation with the player specified. Example: ‘/helper pm SugarKoala’ would return the following link, http://mcmiddleearth.com/conversations/add?to=SugarKoala 

The devinfo is basicly just to allow us devs to view important information.
